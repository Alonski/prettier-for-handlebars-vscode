# Prettier for Handlebars - A fork of Handlebars Formatter

This extension allow you to format handlebars files using the currently unreleased Prettier `glimmer` parser

Because it uses unreleased, it may break with future changes to Prettier.

## Why Prettier for Handlebars exists VS Handlebars Formatter

This fork exists because of a difference in the hard coded Prettier dependency.

Currently Prettier for Handlebars uses Prettier v1.18.2 while [Handlebars Formatter](https://github.com/mfeckie/handlebars-formatter) uses something more modern.

Because the Prettier `glimmer` parser is still experimental it tends to break. There were idempotency issues with versions above v1.18.2.

Once these are fixed then this extension will be updated accordingly.

Final reason: I, Alon, like my name better ðŸ™‚
